# Moderator_Scoring_Sheet_Form
This is a form, similar to a normal google form, but a bit advanced than it as it supports features to automatically add/multiply/subtract and display multiple text inputs. 
The code contains HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP elements and can be edited to judge any competition globally. JavaScript will automatically calculate point differentials and declare winner at the end of the form.
